// # token
// Japanese sentences can be decomposed into various elements that make up the sentence, 
// such as letters, words, sentences, and paragraphs.
// C language programs can be decomposed in the same way.
// When grammatically decomposing a C language program, the smallest unit is a "token".
int
main
(
void
)
{
return
0
;
}
// # free format
// C language is a "free format", and there are loose restrictions on how to write programs,
// so you can write freely.
// But there is only one clear rule for writing C programs.
// That is, "don't write tokens together".
// However, there are exceptions, that is the "symbols can be connexted and written".

// # other rules
// 1. C is case sensitive.
// 2. C is supposed to write the ";" symbol at the end of the sentence.
// 3. C language cannot recognize double-byte characters.
